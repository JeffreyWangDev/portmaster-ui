pilot-widget-NetworkRating-Danger:
  title: Danger Rating
  content: |
    This rating is for emergencies, when you have a reasonable suspicion that the network is hacked or otherwise hostile to you.

    The Portmaster will become over-protective in this mode, which might also break functionality of apps or render them useless. Please note that some settings cannot be turned off for the Danger Rating in order to ensure a secure baseline that is always available to you and cannot be misconfigured.
