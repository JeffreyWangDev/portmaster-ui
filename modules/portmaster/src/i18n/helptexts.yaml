    Control your privacy even when connecting to new networks.

    In the Portmaster you configure settings to be active in one environment but not in the other, like allowing sensitive connections at home but not at the public library.

    The only thing you have to do is to change the network rating whenever you connect to a different network.

    - **Danger**: This setting is only enforced when you set your Network Rating to "Danger"
    - **Untrusted**: This setting is both enforced in the "Danger" _AND_ in the "Untrusted" environment
