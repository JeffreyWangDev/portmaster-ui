    Control your privacy even when connecting to new networks.

    In the Portmaster you configure settings to be active in one environment but not in the other, like allowing sensitive connections at home but not at the public library.

    The only thing you have to do is to change the network rating whenever you connect to a different network.

    View connections as they happen. When live-mode is disabled, you can manually refresh the view after new connections arise.

    Click on any connection to view more details and to take action.

    Connections may be in one of the following states:

    <span class="verdict accept"></span> ... the connection has been allowed. <br />
    <span class="block verdict"></span> ... the connection has been blocked. <br />
    <span class="verdict failed"></span> ... the connection has failed. <br />

    If the app settings have changed after a connection has been evaluated, the status is displayed as an outline:<br />
    <span class="verdict accept outdated"></span>
    <span class="block verdict outdated"></span>
    <span class="verdict failed outdated"></span>

    <small>_Note: By default every row is one connection. If this becomes overwhelming, try showing connections "by Domain", accessible when clicking "Next"_</small>
